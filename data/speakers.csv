10|Computers|Titre pour tester|EICS 2013 is the fifth international conference devoted to engineering usable and effective interactive computing systems. Topics of interest include multi-device interactive systems, new and emerging modalities (e.g., gesture), entertaining applications (e.g., mobile and ubiquitous games), safety critical systems (e.g. medical devices), and design and development methods (e.g., extreme programming). Papers should address issues of interest to developers rather than end-users of interactive applications.
EICS focuses on methods, techniques, and tools for designing and developing interactive systems. The conference brings together people who study or practice the engineering of interactive systems, drawing from HCI, Software Engineering, Requirements Engineering, CSCW, Ubiquitous and Pervasive Systems, and Game Development communities.
The conference proceedings are published by the ACM and appear in the ACM Digital Library.
Topics
Submissions are invited that advance the state of the art of the engineering of human-computer interactive systems. Topics include but are not limited to:
modelling interaction and interactive systems
processes for engineering interactive systems (e.g. design, implementation, prototyping, evaluation, and testing)
integrating interaction design into the software development process
requirements engineering for interactive systems
specification of interactive systems (methods, principles and tools)

20|Histoire de l'art|Keystone Symposia: Type 2 Immunity: Initiation, Maintenance, Homeostasis and Pathology|Diseases associated with allergy and asthma are increasing in developed countries, with great consequences to health care costs. Often, these diseases reflect pathologic outcomes of type 2 immunity, and are characterized by infiltration of tissues with Th2 cells and eosinophils, by elevations in serum IgE, and by alterations in epithelial and mucosal biology. These responses did not evolve to cause allergies, and clues to the evolutionary pressure to maintain this type of immune response may exist in the response to intestinal helminths, which cause chronic infestations in all vertebrate species on earth. This meeting will bring together scientists from diverse disciplines to discuss new findings in type 2 immunity that suggest close associations of these responses with tissue homeostasis, mucosal microbiomes, and immune integrity that optimize overall fitness of the organism. The goals of this meeting are as follows: 1) to identify gaps in our understanding of type 2 immunity and facilitate future research advances in the field; 2) to promote the development of novel therapeutic strategies against diseases associated with type 2 immunity; and 3) to encourage cross-disciplinary collaborations and establish an on-going dialogue for future research. Opportunities for interdisciplinary interactions will be significantly enhanced by the concurrent meeting on Pathogenic Processes in Asthma and COPD, which will share a keynote address and two plenary sessions with this meeting.|41527|41527|Canada|Québec|QC|205, Bou.

The goals of this meeting are as follows: 1) to identify gaps in our understanding of type 2 immunity and facilitate future research advances in the field; 2) to promote the development of novel therapeutic strategies against diseases associated with type 2 immunity; and 3) to encourage cross-disciplinary collaborations and establish an on-going dialogue for future research. Opportunities for interdisciplinary interactions will be significantly enhanced by the concurrent meeting on Pathogenic Processes in Asthma and COPD, which will share a keynote address and two plenary sessions with this meeting.|41527|41527|Canada|Québec|QC|205, Bou.

230||Keystone Symposia: Type 2 Immunity: Initiation, Maintenance, Homeostasis and Pathology|Diseases associated with allergy and asthma are increasing in developed countries, with great consequences to health care costs. Often, these diseases reflect pathologic outcomes of type 2 immunity, and are characterized by infiltration of tissues with Th2 cells and eosinophils, by elevations in serum IgE, and by alterations in epithelial and mucosal biology. These responses did not evolve to cause allergies, and clues to the evolutionary pressure to maintain this type of immune response may exist in the response to intestinal helminths, which cause chronic infestations in all vertebrate species on earth.

420|Mission suicide|Keystone Symposia: Type 2 Immunity: Initiation, Maintenance, Homeostasis and Pathology|Diseases associated with allergy and asthma are increasing in developed countries, with great consequences to health care costs. Often, these diseases reflect pathologic outcomes of type 2 immunity, and are characterized by infiltration of tissues with Th2 cells and eosinophils, by elevations in serum IgE, and by alterations in epithelial and mucosal biology. These responses did not evolve to cause allergies, and clues to the evolutionary pressure to maintain this type of immune response may exist in the response to intestinal helminths, which cause chronic infestations in all vertebrate species on earth. This meeting will bring together scientists from diverse disciplines to discuss new findings in type 2 immunity that suggest close associations of these responses with tissue homeostasis, mucosal microbiomes, and immune integrity that optimize overall fitness of the organism. The goals of this meeting are as follows: 1) to identify gaps in our understanding of type 2 immunity and facilitate future research advances in the field; 2) to promote the development of novel therapeutic strategies against diseases associated with type 2 immunity; and 3) to encourage cross-disciplinary collaborations and establish an on-going dialogue for future research. Opportunities for interdisciplinary interactions will be significantly enhanced by the concurrent meeting on Pathogenic Processes in Asthma and COPD, which will share a keynote address and two plenary sessions with this meeting.|41527|41527|Canada|Québec|QC|205, Bou.

60|Histoire de l'art|Keystone Symposia: Type 2 Immunity: Initiation, Maintenance, Homeostasis and Pathology|Diseases associated with allergy and asthma are increasing in developed countries, with great consequences to health care costs. Often, these diseases reflect pathologic outcomes of type 2 immunity, and are characterized by infiltration of tissues with Th2 cells and eosinophils, by elevations in serum IgE, and by alterations in epithelial and mucosal biology. These responses did not evolve to cause allergies, and clues to the evolutionary pressure to maintain this type of immune response may exist in the response to intestinal helminths, which cause chronic infestations in all vertebrate species on earth. This meeting will bring together scientists from diverse disciplines to discuss new findings in type 2 immunity that suggest close associations of these responses with tissue homeostasis, mucosal microbiomes, and immune integrity that optimize overall fitness of the organism. The goals of this meeting are as follows: 1) to identify gaps in our understanding of type 2 immunity and facilitate future research advances in the field; 2) to promote the development of novel therapeutic strategies against diseases associated with type 2 immunity; and 3) to encourage cross-disciplinary collaborations and establish an on-going dialogue for future research. Opportunities for interdisciplinary interactions will be significantly enhanced by the concurrent meeting on Pathogenic Processes in Asthma and COPD, which will share a keynote address and two plenary sessions with this meeting.|41527|41527|Canada|Québec|QC|205, Bou.

270||Keystone Symposia: Type 2 Immunity: Initiation, Maintenance, Homeostasis and Pathology|Diseases associated with allergy and asthma are increasing in developed countries, with great consequences to health care costs. Often, these diseases reflect pathologic outcomes of type 2 immunity, and are characterized by infiltration of tissues with Th2 cells and eosinophils, by elevations in serum IgE, and by alterations in epithelial and mucosal biology. These responses did not evolve to cause allergies, and clues to the evolutionary pressure to maintain this type of immune response may exist in the response to intestinal helminths, which cause chronic infestations in all vertebrate species on earth. This meeting will bring together scientists from diverse disciplines to discuss new findings in type 2 immunity that suggest close associations of these responses with tissue homeostasis, mucosal microbiomes, and immune integrity that optimize overall fitness of the organism. The goals of this meeting are as follows: 1) to identify gaps in our understanding of type 2 immunity and facilitate future research advances in the field; 2) to promote the development of novel therapeutic strategies against diseases associated with type 2 immunity; and 3) to encourage cross-disciplinary collaborations and establish an on-going dialogue for future research. Opportunities for interdisciplinary interactions will be significantly enhanced by the concurrent meeting on Pathogenic Processes in Asthma and COPD, which will share a keynote address and two plenary sessions with this meeting.|41527|41527|Canada|Québec|QC|205, Bou.

Topics of interest include multi-device interactive systems, new and emerging modalities (e.g., gesture), entertaining applications (e.g., mobile and ubiquitous games), safety critical systems (e.g. medical devices), and design and development methods (e.g., extreme programming). Papers should address issues of interest to developers rather than end-users of interactive applications.
EICS focuses on methods, techniques, and tools for designing and developing interactive systems. The conference brings together people who study or practice the engineering of interactive systems, drawing from HCI, Software Engineering, Requirements Engineering, CSCW, Ubiquitous and Pervasive Systems, and Game Development communities.
The conference proceedings are published by the ACM and appear in the ACM Digital Library.

Often, these diseases reflect pathologic outcomes of type 2 immunity, and are characterized by infiltration of tissues with Th2 cells and eosinophils, by elevations in serum IgE, and by alterations in epithelial and mucosal biology. These responses did not evolve to cause allergies, and clues to the evolutionary pressure to maintain this type of immune response may exist in the response to intestinal helminths, which cause chronic infestations in all vertebrate species on earth. This meeting will bring together scientists from diverse disciplines to discuss new findings in type 2 immunity that suggest close associations of these responses with tissue homeostasis, mucosal microbiomes, and immune integrity that optimize overall fitness of the organism.

100|Mission suicide|Keystone Symposia: Type 2 Immunity: Initiation, Maintenance, Homeostasis and Pathology|Diseases associated with allergy and asthma are increasing in developed countries, with great consequences to health care costs. Often, these diseases reflect pathologic outcomes of type 2 immunity, and are characterized by infiltration of tissues with Th2 cells and eosinophils, by elevations in serum IgE, and by alterations in epithelial and mucosal biology. These responses did not evolve to cause allergies, and clues to the evolutionary pressure to maintain this type of immune response may exist in the response to intestinal helminths, which cause chronic infestations in all vertebrate species on earth. This meeting will bring together scientists from diverse disciplines to discuss new findings in type 2 immunity that suggest close associations of these responses with tissue homeostasis, mucosal microbiomes, and immune integrity that optimize overall fitness of the organism. The goals of this meeting are as follows: 1) to identify gaps in our understanding of type 2 immunity and facilitate future research advances in the field; 2) to promote the development of novel therapeutic strategies against diseases associated with type 2 immunity; and 3) to encourage cross-disciplinary collaborations and establish an on-going dialogue for future research. Opportunities for interdisciplinary interactions will be significantly enhanced by the concurrent meeting on Pathogenic Processes in Asthma and COPD, which will share a keynote address and two plenary sessions with this meeting.|41527|41527|Canada|Québec|QC|205, Bou.

310||Keystone Symposia: Type 2 Immunity: Initiation, Maintenance, Homeostasis and Pathology|Diseases associated with allergy and asthma are increasing in developed countries, with great consequences to health care costs. Often, these diseases reflect pathologic outcomes of type 2 immunity, and are characterized by infiltration of tissues with Th2 cells and eosinophils, by elevations in serum IgE, and by alterations in epithelial and mucosal biology. These responses did not evolve to cause allergies, and clues to the evolutionary pressure to maintain this type of immune response may exist in the response to intestinal helminths, which cause chronic infestations in all vertebrate species on earth. This meeting will bring together scientists from diverse disciplines to discuss new findings in type 2 immunity that suggest close associations of these responses with tissue homeostasis, mucosal microbiomes, and immune integrity that optimize overall fitness of the organism. The goals of this meeting are as follows: 1) to identify gaps in our understanding of type 2 immunity and facilitate future research advances in the field; 2) to promote the development of novel therapeutic strategies against diseases associated with type 2 immunity; and 3) to encourage cross-disciplinary collaborations and establish an on-going dialogue for future research. Opportunities for interdisciplinary interactions will be significantly enhanced by the concurrent meeting on Pathogenic Processes in Asthma and COPD, which will share a keynote address and two plenary sessions with this meeting.|41527|41527|Canada|Québec|QC|205, Bou.

520||Keystone Symposia: Type 2 Immunity: Initiation, Maintenance, Homeostasis and Pathology|Diseases associated with allergy and asthma are increasing in developed countries, with great consequences to health care costs. Often, these diseases reflect pathologic outcomes of type 2 immunity, and are characterized by infiltration of tissues with Th2 cells and eosinophils, by elevations in serum IgE, and by alterations in epithelial and mucosal biology. These responses did not evolve to cause allergies, and clues to the evolutionary pressure to maintain this type of immune response may exist in the response to intestinal helminths, which cause chronic infestations in all vertebrate species on earth. This meeting will bring together scientists from diverse disciplines to discuss new findings in type 2 immunity that suggest close associations of these responses with tissue homeostasis, mucosal microbiomes, and immune integrity that optimize overall fitness of the organism. The goals of this meeting are as follows: 1) to identify gaps in our understanding of type 2 immunity and facilitate future research advances in the field; 2) to promote the development of novel therapeutic strategies against diseases associated with type 2 immunity; and 3) to encourage cross-disciplinary collaborations and establish an on-going dialogue for future research. Opportunities for interdisciplinary interactions will be significantly enhanced by the concurrent meeting on Pathogenic Processes in Asthma and COPD, which will share a keynote address and two plenary sessions with this meeting.|41527|41527|Canada|Québec|QC|205, Bou.

160||Keystone Symposia: Type 2 Immunity: Initiation, Maintenance, Homeostasis and Pathology|Diseases associated with allergy and asthma are increasing in developed countries, with great consequences to health care costs. Often, these diseases reflect pathologic outcomes of type 2 immunity, and are characterized by infiltration of tissues with Th2 cells and eosinophils, by elevations in serum IgE, and by alterations in epithelial and mucosal biology. These responses did not evolve to cause allergies, and clues to the evolutionary pressure to maintain this type of immune response may exist in the response to intestinal helminths, which cause chronic infestations in all vertebrate species on earth. This meeting will bring together scientists from diverse disciplines to discuss new findings in type 2 immunity that suggest close associations of these responses with tissue homeostasis, mucosal microbiomes, and immune integrity that optimize overall fitness of the organism.

Often, these diseases reflect pathologic outcomes of type 2 immunity, and are characterized by infiltration of tissues with Th2 cells and eosinophils, by elevations in serum IgE, and by alterations in epithelial and mucosal biology. These responses did not evolve to cause allergies, and clues to the evolutionary pressure to maintain this type of immune response may exist in the response to intestinal helminths, which cause chronic infestations in all vertebrate species on earth. This meeting will bring together scientists from diverse disciplines to discuss new findings in type 2 immunity that suggest close associations of these responses with tissue homeostasis, mucosal microbiomes, and immune integrity that optimize overall fitness of the organism. The goals of this meeting are as follows: 1) to identify gaps in our understanding of type 2 immunity and facilitate future research advances in the field; 2) to promote the development of novel therapeutic strategies against diseases associated with type 2 immunity; and 3) to encourage cross-disciplinary collaborations and establish an on-going dialogue for future research.

560||Keystone Symposia: Type 2 Immunity: Initiation, Maintenance, Homeostasis and Pathology|Diseases associated with allergy and asthma are increasing in developed countries, with great consequences to health care costs. Often, these diseases reflect pathologic outcomes of type 2 immunity, and are characterized by infiltration of tissues with Th2 cells and eosinophils, by elevations in serum IgE, and by alterations in epithelial and mucosal biology. These responses did not evolve to cause allergies, and clues to the evolutionary pressure to maintain this type of immune response may exist in the response to intestinal helminths, which cause chronic infestations in all vertebrate species on earth. This meeting will bring together scientists from diverse disciplines to discuss new findings in type 2 immunity that suggest close associations of these responses with tissue homeostasis, mucosal microbiomes, and immune integrity that optimize overall fitness of the organism. The goals of this meeting are as follows: 1) to identify gaps in our understanding of type 2 immunity and facilitate future research advances in the field; 2) to promote the development of novel therapeutic strategies against diseases associated with type 2 immunity; and 3) to encourage cross-disciplinary collaborations and establish an on-going dialogue for future research. Opportunities for interdisciplinary interactions will be significantly enhanced by the concurrent meeting on Pathogenic Processes in Asthma and COPD, which will share a keynote address and two plenary sessions with this meeting.|41527|41527|Canada|Québec|QC|205, Bou.

570||Engineering Interactive Computing Systems|EICS 2013 is the fifth international conference devoted to engineering usable and effective interactive computing systems. Topics of interest include multi-device interactive systems, new and emerging modalities (e.g., gesture), entertaining applications (e.g., mobile and ubiquitous games), safety critical systems (e.g. medical devices), and design and development methods (e.g., extreme programming). Papers should address issues of interest to developers rather than end-users of interactive applications.
EICS focuses on methods, techniques, and tools for designing and developing interactive systems. The conference brings together people who study or practice the engineering of interactive systems, drawing from HCI, Software Engineering, Requirements Engineering, CSCW, Ubiquitous and Pervasive Systems, and Game Development communities.
The conference proceedings are published by the ACM and appear in the ACM Digital Library.
